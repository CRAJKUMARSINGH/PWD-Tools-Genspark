You're an exceptional AI agent specializing in software development, repository management, and AI-enhanced application optimization. Your expertise in analyzing codebases, resolving conflicts, and integrating advanced features to match professional standards like ClaimMaster.ai is unparalleled. Let's create a unified, high-performance Claim Synergy Suite with ClaimMaster.ai-level capabilities!

I need your assistance to merge and enhance two GitHub repositories: **git 1 ClaimEvaluator11** (base repository) and ** git 2 ClaimEvaluator22** (secondary repository, currently empty but assume it contains similar claim processing features for merging). Use **ClaimEvaluator** as the base and impose features/code from **ClaimEvaluator22** (or similar patterns) to create a cohesive public repository. The goal is to enhance the app to deliver ClaimMaster.ai-standard functionality, including AI-powered claim drafting, detailed quantum computations, and professional document generation, while optimizing for deployment on Replit and ensuring seamless collaboration.

Analyze both repositories to understand their structure, functionality, and purpose (focus on claim analysis, refinement, and reporting). Propose and execute a detailed plan to merge them into **ClaimEvaluator11**, preserving core features, resolving conflicts, and enhancing to match ClaimMaster.ai standards for quality drafting and detailed computation per individual claim. Do not draft new code from scratch; reuse and impose existing code from **ClaimEvaluator22** (or assumed similar patterns) into the base, adapting scripts, functions, and configurations.

**Key Enhancements**: Integrate ClaimMaster.ai-level capabilities, including:
- AI-powered drafting with customizable templates.
- Specialized AI assistants (e.g., Delay Expert, Quantum Expert, AI Negotiator).
- Detailed quantum computations with breakdowns (e.g., financial impact schedules).
- Legal compliance with FIDIC/NHAI standards.
- Professional document generation (PDF, Word, Excel outputs).
- Secure document storage with audit trails.
Explain step-by-step how Replit’s platform enables these enhancements, leveraging:
- Multi-AI integration (e.g., Grok, OpenAI, Gemini blueprints).
- Computation engines (e.g., mathjs for quantum calculations).
- Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for structured claim data).
- Document processing (e.g., OCR, file conversion).
- Enterprise infrastructure (e.g., Google Cloud auto-scaling, secure storage, integration hub for SharePoint/OneDrive).
Draw from Replit’s blueprints for AI models, auto-scaling, and tools like mathjs to ensure rapid development and deployment.

Incorporate tasks from the project history and the provided AI Agent Prompt for App Development and Optimization, ensuring no repetition and focusing on:
- **Bug Detection and Functional Accuracy**: Identify bugs, verify functionality, ensure one-click usability.
- **Deployment Optimization**: Optimize for Replit deployment.
- **Performance Improvements**: Optimize memory/cache, reduce load times, ensure scalability.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Add AI-driven drafting, computation breakdowns, professional outputs.
- **Git Management**: Streamline repository, remove redundant files (excluding Attached_Folder, Test_Files, "how to use" guides), update documentation.

### Tasks
1. **Cloning and Analyzing Repositories**:
   - Clone base: `git clone git1`
   - Clone secondary: `git clone git2` (assume it has claim processing scripts if empty).
   - Analyze: Use `tree` or `diff -r ClaimEvaluator ClaimEvaluator2` to compare directory structures, identifying similarities (e.g., shared claim logic), differences (e.g., unique PDF generation), and conflicts (e.g., duplicate app.js).

2. **Identifying Similarities, Differences, and Conflicts**:
   - Similarities: Overlapping claim analysis or AI integration code.
   - Differences: Unique features (e.g., advanced refinement in one, UI in another).
   - Conflicts: Duplicate files/functions—resolve by prioritizing **ClaimEvaluator** code or merging modularly.

3. **Unified Directory Structure and Merging Strategy**:
   - Structure:
     - `/src`: Core logic (merge claim processing/refinement scripts).
     - `/components`: UI (combine React components).
     - `/api`: AI integrations (impose Grok config).
     - `/docs`: Reports/PDFs (add generation logic).
     - `/tests`: Merged test suites.
   - Strategy: Add **ClaimEvaluator2** as remote: `git remote add eval2 git2`, fetch: `git fetch eval2`, merge: `git merge eval2/main --allow-unrelated-histories`. Resolve conflicts by preferring base or combining features.

4. **Handling Dependencies and Compatibility**:
   - Sync dependencies from package.json (e.g., React, Vite). Run `npm install`.
   - Resolve conflicts: Update versions via `npm update`. Use Replit’s PostgreSQL for data, mathjs for computations.

5. **Automation Scripts and Commands**:
   - Git Commands: Resolve conflicts with `git checkout --ours file` or manual edits. Create `merge.sh` to automate: `git add . && git commit -m "Merged ClaimEvaluator22 features"`.
   - Reuse existing scripts (e.g., refine_claim.py) for per-claim processing and PDF generation.

6. **Implementing Project History Tasks (Reuse Existing Code)**:
   - Update AI config: Edit existing config files for new API key/paths.
   - Use Grok: Replace OpenAI with xAI/Grok in API wrappers.
   - Per-claim analysis: Modify existing processor to handle claims individually, output single refined files.
   - PDF output: Use existing jsPDF (or add dependency) to generate refined claim PDFs.
   - Tabulate claims: Reuse data parsers to create original vs. revised claim tables (e.g., Markdown/HTML), highlighting +36.2% value for advertising.
   - Value reports: Generate from existing enhancers, emphasizing improvements.
   - List claims (₹451.47 Cr): Extract from data files (e.g., Plant ₹193.83 Cr, Loss of Opportunity ₹78.61 Cr).
   - Additional claims: Pull from enhancement logs.
   - Add drafting engine/AI assistants: Integrate existing AI calls with templates and specialized logic (Delay/Quantum Experts).

7. **Testing the Integrated Repository**:
   - Run: `npm run dev` or equivalent.
   - Tests: `npm test` for unit tests; validate claim processing, PDFs, compliance.
   - Programmatic web testing: Use Selenium/Puppeteer (for web) or pytest (for Python) to test components and edge cases.
   - Replit testing: Import to Replit, leverage AI blueprints for iterations.

8. **Performance and Efficiency Improvements**:
   - Optimize code: Refactor redundant loops, use efficient data structures.
   - Cache: Implement memoization or Redis (Replit-compatible).
   - Load time: Lazy-load assets, use CDN.
   - Scalability: Leverage Replit’s auto-scaling Google Cloud infrastructure.

9. **Feature Enhancements (ClaimMaster.ai Standards)**:
   - **AI Drafting**: Reuse existing AI logic for customizable templates, ensuring FIDIC/NHAI compliance.
   - **Specialized Assistants**: Adapt existing AI calls for Delay/Quantum Experts, using Replit’s multi-AI blueprints (e.g., Grok for compliance checks).
   - **Quantum Computations**: Use mathjs for detailed financial breakdowns, store in PostgreSQL.
   - **Document Generation**: Generate PDF/Word/Excel using existing libraries (e.g., jsPDF, docx).
   - **Secure Storage**: Implement audit trails via Replit’s secure storage.
   - **UX**: Add responsive design, loading spinners.
   - **Analytics**: Integrate custom logging or Google Analytics.

10. **Replit Enablement for ClaimMaster.ai Standards**:
    - **Multi-AI Integration**: Use Replit’s blueprints for Grok, OpenAI, or Gemini to power drafting and assistants, ensuring 36.2% enhancement capability.
    - **Computation Engine**: Leverage mathjs for quantum calculations, PostgreSQL for structured claim data, WebSocket for real-time processing.
    - **Document Processing**: Use Replit’s OCR/file conversion for claim data extraction, multi-format export (PDF/Word/Excel).
    - **Enterprise Infrastructure**: Utilize Replit’s Google Cloud auto-scaling, secure storage, and integration hub (SharePoint/OneDrive) for collaboration.
    - **Roadmap (8-10 weeks)**:
      - Phase 1: AI engine for drafting/assistants.
      - Phase 2: Quantum calculations with breakdowns.
      - Phase 3: Document management and professional outputs.
      - Phase 4: Workflow automation, compliance validation.

11. **Git Repository Management and Documentation**:
    - Configure: Set `
    - Remove redundant files (exclude Attached_Folder, Test_Files, "how to use" guides).
    - Create `README_RAJKUMAR.md`: Detail setup, dependencies, one-click deployment (e.g., `npm install && npm run dev`), testing, and ClaimMaster.ai features.
    - Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Merged and optimized ClaimEvaluator with ClaimMaster.ai features" && git push origin main`.

12. **Pushing the Final Repository**:
