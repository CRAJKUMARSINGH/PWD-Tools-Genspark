# Corrected Tool Linking Report

## Issue Summary
The Streamlit application was linking to incorrect or non-existent tools. There was confusion between multiple tool collections in the project:
1. Integrated Streamlit tools (in app.py)
2. Separate page tools (in pages directory)
3. Desktop tools (in various Python files)

## Root Cause Analysis
The [streamlit_app.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Rajkumar/PWD-Tools-Genspark/streamlit_app.py#L1-L102) file was referencing tools that either didn't exist or weren't the intended tools. It was mixing concepts between different tool collections.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Identified Actual Tool Files
Verified the actual page files that exist in the `pages` directory:
- pages/01_EMD_Refund.py
- pages/02_Deductions_Table.py
- pages/03_Delay_Calculator.py
- pages/04_Stamp_Duty.py
- pages/05_Placeholders.py

### 2. Updated Tool Registry
Corrected the tool registry in [streamlit_app.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Rajkumar/PWD-Tools-Genspark/streamlit_app.py#L1-L102) to link to the actual existing page files:
- EMD Refund → pages/01_EMD_Refund.py
- Deductions Table → pages/02_Deductions_Table.py
- Delay Calculator → pages/03_Delay_Calculator.py
- Stamp Duty Calculator → pages/04_Stamp_Duty.py
- Placeholders → pages/05_Placeholders.py

### 3. Maintained Proper Navigation
- Used `st.switch_page()` for local tool navigation
- Preserved screenshot display functionality
- Kept external tool links separate (if any)

## Files Modified
1. [streamlit_app.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Rajkumar/PWD-Tools-Genspark/streamlit_app.py#L1-L102) - Updated tool registry to link to correct page files

## Verification
The application has been successfully tested and is running on http://0.0.0.0:8508

## Current Working Tools
1. ✅ EMD Refund - Calculates EMD refund eligibility and amounts
2. ✅ Deductions Table - Calculates TDS, Security, and other deductions
3. ✅ Delay Calculator - Calculates project delays and timeline analysis
4. ✅ Stamp Duty Calculator - Calculates stamp duty for work orders
5. ✅ Placeholders - Placeholder for additional tools

## Benefits
- Users now land on the correct, existing tools
- Navigation is consistent and reliable
- All tools are properly linked to their respective page files
- Eliminates confusion between different tool collections
- Maintains visual consistency with screenshots

## How to Use
1. Access the main dashboard at http://localhost:8508
2. Click "Open Tool" buttons to navigate to specific tools
3. Each tool will open in the same Streamlit application
4. Use browser back button or refresh to return to main dashboard

## Testing Results
All local tools have been verified to exist and function correctly:
- ✅ pages/01_EMD_Refund.py - EMD Refund calculator
- ✅ pages/02_Deductions_Table.py - Deductions table calculator
- ✅ pages/03_Delay_Calculator.py - Delay calculator
- ✅ pages/04_Stamp_Duty.py - Stamp duty calculator
- ✅ pages/05_Placeholders.py - Placeholder page
