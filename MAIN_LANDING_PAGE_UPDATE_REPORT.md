## Objective
Make [app.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Rajkumar/PWD-Tools-Genspark/app.py#L1-L195) the main landing page instead of [streamlit_landing.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Rajkumar/PWD-Tools-Genspark/streamlit_landing.py#L1-L707) or [pwd_main_landing.py](file:///c%3A/Users/Rajkumar/PWD-Tools-Genspark/pwd_main_landing.py#L1-L325).
