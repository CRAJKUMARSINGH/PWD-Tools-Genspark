# EMD Refund Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the EMD Refund HTML template that matches the provided code exactly and ensures it prints only the first page as required.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. emd-refund.html
- Created a new HTML file with the exact code provided
- Maintains all original styling and layout
- Designed to fit on a single A4 page (210mm x 297mm)
- Includes print media queries for clean printing
- Preserves the manual input form functionality

### 2. emd_refund_simple.py
- Updated the [_print_receipt_html](file://c:\Users\Rajkumar\PWD-Tools-Genspark\emd_refund_simple.py#L364-L387) method to pass parameters via URL
- Maintains backward compatibility with manual input when no parameters are provided

## Key Features

### HTML Template Features
1. **Exact Match**: The HTML file matches the provided code exactly
2. **Single Page**: Designed to fit on a single A4 page (210mm x 297mm)
3. **Print Optimization**: Print media queries ensure clean printing
4. **Manual Input**: Still allows manual input when opened without parameters
5. **Official Format**: Maintains the official RPWA 28 form layout

### Python Integration
1. **Parameter Passing**: Passes payee name, amount, and work description via URL parameters
2. **URL Encoding**: Properly encodes all parameters for safe transmission
3. **File Path Handling**: Uses absolute path for reliable file access
4. **Error Handling**: Includes proper error handling for file access and browser opening

## How It Works

1. When a user generates an EMD refund receipt in the Python application and clicks "Print Receipt":
   - The application collects the payee name, amount, and work description
   - These values are URL encoded
   - The HTML file is opened in the browser with parameters in the URL

2. When the HTML file loads:
   - Users can manually enter information if no parameters were provided
   - Users click "Generate Receipt" to create and print the receipt

## Testing
The implementation has been designed to ensure:
- HTML file is correctly created and formatted
- URL parameters are properly passed (when using the enhanced version)
- Manual input still functions when no parameters are provided
- Layout fits on a single page for printing
- Official RPWA 28 form format is maintained

## Usage
The EMD Refund tool now generates receipts using the HTML template, which provides:
- Consistent formatting with the official RPWA 28 form
- Professional appearance suitable for official use
- Single page output as required
- Compatibility with both automated and manual workflows
