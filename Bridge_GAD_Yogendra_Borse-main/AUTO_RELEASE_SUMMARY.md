# üöÄ Bridge_GAD Auto-Release Workflow Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the automated release workflow for Bridge_GAD.

## üéØ Overview

The auto-release workflow enables fully automated building, signing, and publishing of Bridge_GAD releases to GitHub whenever a Git tag is pushed to the repository.

## üß© Components Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Trigger**: Git tags matching pattern `v*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Jobs**:
  - **Build**: Windows runner that builds executables and documentation
  - **Release**: Ubuntu runner that publishes GitHub Release

### 2. Build Process
- **Tool**: PyInstaller for creating standalone executables
- **Executables**:
  - `Bridge_GAD_GUI.exe` - Graphical User Interface
  - `Bridge_GAD.exe` - Command Line Interface
- **Dependencies**: Automatic installation of all required packages

### 3. Documentation Generation
- **Tool**: pypandoc for PDF generation
- **Output**: `Bridge_GAD_User_Manual.pdf`
- **Template**: Markdown-based user manual template

### 4. Code Signing
- **Optional**: Automatic digital signing when certificate is provided
- **Tool**: Windows signtool
- **Certificate**: Base64 encoded `.pfx` file stored as GitHub secret

### 5. Installer Creation
- **Tool**: Inno Setup (pre-installed on GitHub Actions Windows runners)
- **Output**: `Bridge_GAD_Setup.exe` - Professional Windows installer

### 6. Release Publishing
- **Tool**: softprops/action-gh-release
- **Assets**: All executables, installer, and documentation
- **Notes**: Automatically generated release notes

## üìÅ Files Created

### Workflow Files
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Main release workflow
- `GITHUB_RELEASE_README.md` - Documentation for the release process

### Helper Scripts
- `create_git_tag.bat` - Script to easily create and push tags
- `verify_executables.bat` - Script to verify built executables

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Code Signing (Optional)
To enable automatic code signing:

1. Convert your `.pfx` certificate to base64:
   ```bash
   base64 -i certificate.pfx -o cert_base64.txt
   ```

2. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `SIGNING_CERT` - Base64 content of your certificate
   - `SIGNING_PASS` - Password for your certificate

### 2. Creating Releases
To create a new release:

```bash
# Use the helper script
create_git_tag.bat

# Or manually create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

## üîÑ Workflow Process

1. **Tag Creation**: Developer creates and pushes a new tag
2. **Workflow Trigger**: GitHub Actions workflow starts automatically
3. **Build Phase**: Windows runner builds all executables
4. **Documentation**: User manual is generated in PDF format
5. **Signing**: Executables are signed with provided certificate
6. **Packaging**: Windows installer is created
7. **Release**: Ubuntu runner publishes the GitHub Release
8. **Notification**: Release is available in the GitHub Releases tab

## üì§ Release Assets

Each release includes:
- `Bridge_GAD_GUI.exe` - GUI executable (standalone)
- `Bridge_GAD.exe` - CLI executable (standalone)
- `Bridge_GAD_Setup.exe` - Windows installer
- `Bridge_GAD_User_Manual.pdf` - Complete user manual

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Automation**: No manual steps required for release publishing
- **Consistency**: Standardized build and release process
- **Security**: Optional code signing for verified executables
- **Documentation**: Automatic generation of user manuals
- **Distribution**: Professional installer for easy deployment
- **Transparency**: Clear release notes and asset descriptions

## üß™ Verification

The workflow has been tested and verified to:
- Build executables correctly on Windows runners
- Generate documentation in PDF format
- Sign executables when certificate is provided
- Create Windows installer with Inno Setup
- Publish releases with proper assets and notes

## üöÄ Next Steps

After a successful release:
1. **Verify**: Check GitHub Releases tab for new release
2. **Test**: Download and test the executables
3. **Announce**: Share the release with users
4. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues reported by users

The auto-release workflow is now fully operational and ready for production use.
