### 3. Enhanced Abutment Drawing
- **Full Abutment Geometry**: Implemented complete abutment drawing with all structural elements
- **Elevation View**: Detailed elevation view with face, toe, and back elements
- **Plan View**: Complete plan view with skew adjustments
- **Proper Dimensioning**: Accurate dimensioning and annotations
- **Structural Details**: All abutment components including dirt wall, cap, and footings

### 4. Enhanced Layout Grid System
- **Professional Grid**: Improved grid system with proper bed level and chainage markers
- **Level Annotations**: Accurate level annotations at regular intervals
- **Chainage Markers**: Proper chainage markers with annotations
- **Dimension Lines**: Added dimension lines and extension lines for professional appearance

### 5. Enhanced Cross-Section Plotting
- **River Cross-Section**: Improved cross-section plotting with chainage markers
- **Level Annotations**: Proper level annotations at each point
- **Grid Markers**: Added grid line markers for reference
- **Professional Formatting**: Enhanced formatting and presentation

### 6. Improved Parameter Handling
- **Additional Parameters**: Added missing parameters for right abutment
- **Better Initialization**: Enhanced parameter initialization and derived variable calculation
- **Skew Angle Support**: Proper handling of bridge skew angles in all calculations

## Files Modified
