I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY drafted a python bridge drawing project using ezdxf library with your tremendous immediate debugging and drafting guidance>>>>>thanks >>>>>today I want to improve >>>>>the super structure in elevation drawing>>>> the code part reproduced here has done to draw all deck slabs of all spans as variable number nspan >>>                          >>> I need to add two approach slabs >>>>>approach slab task will have two new variables..... length of approach slab, width of approach slab and thickness of approach slab LASLAB, APTHK, APWTH..... THIS APPROACH Slab top will be in line with deck slab top drawn and lenth will be at extrem left and extreme right of the deck slab >>>>> please draft the code to reading the variable names from the sheet1 of main excel input sheet refered in main program and drawing as desired ..... please note there will be 25 mm thick expansion joint between deck slab and approach slab>>>>>>further I want to add a wearing course throughout the top extents of deck slab and approach slabs>>>>>>variable name is wcth >>> please draft the code to reading the variable names from the sheet1 of main excel input sheet refered in main program and drawing as desired>>>
